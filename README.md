# Web Collector

A minimalist, yet fully-customizable bookmark manager I built to practice React and Typescript.

## Features

- Bookmarks can be organized into categories and optionally tags.
- Also contains a robust editor for modifying individual bookmarks, along with renaming/deleting whole categories and tags.
- All data is saved locally to the user's browser.

## Future considerations

- Import/export bookmark data
- Backend database with user accounts
- Theme editor
- Drag-and-drop bookmarks to reorder them
- Fetch metadata from a url
